## ‚ú® Repo Pulse: Badges, Stars & Fuel

If you find this project useful or want to support its development, consider sharing it, starring the repo, or even buying me a coffee! Your support keeps the code flowing and the caffeine strong üí™

> [!TIP]
> This list only includes what's already in the repo or tools used to build it, not what I plan to add later.

### üì¢ Shoutouts

I want to additionally thank the following communities and tools that have (often unknowingly) helped this project:

- [Ileriayo/markdown-badges](https://github.com/Ileriayo/markdown-badges/tree/master) - for the awesome badge collection
- [Simple Badges](https://badges.pages.dev/) - for the incredible list of searchable, copy-paste badges
- [Project Types](https://project-types.github.io/) - for the great overview of how to properly categorize your repo
- [GitHub Wiki - Design and Implementation](https://github.com/practicalseries/GitHub-Wiki-Design-and-Implementation/wiki) - for the expert-level digging to figure this thing out before me (seriously, I owe you one!)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you want to start using badges in your own projects, I highly recommend you donate or support the [shields.io project](https://shields.io/) by authorizing their GitHub App, which is free and is a great way to show appreciation for their work! Learn more about it [here](https://shields.io/blog/token-pool).

## üß† Looking for Ideas, Not Code

Have thoughts on:

- What makes a JS template actually useful?
- Underrated tools or workflows that you swear by?
- Opinions about what should (or shouldn‚Äôt) be included in the starter pack?
- Quirky pain points only Node devs understand?

Drop a comment (when Discussions are enabled!) or [reply on Dev.to](https://dev.to/anchildress11/calling-all-nodejs-wizards-what-would-you-add-to-the-ultimate-boilerplate-38aj). Your input could help shape this into something everyone can steal... I mean, use. üòá

## üì¶ Planned Features (So Far)

Here‚Äôs what I‚Äôve mapped out, but this is absolutely up for discussion. Have a hot take? Let me know!

1Ô∏è‚É£ Basic scaffold
2Ô∏è‚É£ Husky with Jira support
3Ô∏è‚É£ Conventional commits & CHANGELOG generation
4Ô∏è‚É£ Prettier auto-format
5Ô∏è‚É£ ESLint validation (strict)
6Ô∏è‚É£ CSpell checks
7Ô∏è‚É£ Vitest for unit and integration testing
8Ô∏è‚É£ Documentation with GitHub Markdown
9Ô∏è‚É£ GitHub Copilot starter

---

## ü§î What‚Äôs Already Here

### Very basic scaffold

- [`README.md`](./README.md) ‚Äì Project overview and starter info (you're reading it!)
- [`commitlint.config.js`](./commitlint.config.mjs) ‚Äì ES6 Commit message linting rules (not yet enforced)
- [`package.json`](./package.json) ‚Äì NPM Node.js project manifest
- [`LICENSE`](./LICENSE) ‚Äì Apache 2.0 License file
- [`index.js`](./index.js) ‚Äì Entry point placeholder
- [`src/`](./src/) ‚Äì Empty source code folder
- [`tests/`](./tests/) ‚Äì Empty test folder
- [`wiki/`](./wiki/) ‚Äì Wiki submodule for comprehensive documentation

---

## üìö Working with Submodules

This project includes a wiki submodule for comprehensive documentation. Here's how to get it set up:

### First-time setup

```bash copy
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

**Or in one command**

```bash copy
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### To pull the latest wiki updates

```bash copy
git submodule update --remote wiki
```

For more detailed documentation and guides, check out [wiki pages](https://github.com/anchildress1/npm-nodejs-template/wiki) or, once you've loaded the submodule, [/wiki](./wiki/Home.md) in your IDE!

## Tooling wish list (all up for feedback!)

### ü¶ä Husky & Jira

- Optional, enforced branch names with Jira keys
- Commit messages that keep the PMs happy
- Lintstaged, because why wait until CI to fail?

### üìù Conventional commits & changelog (started)

- In this area, I'm still a noob, but the goal is to have a system that:
  - Auto-enforce conventional commit format
  - Handles Semver versioning
  - Automatically generates a CHANGELOG

### ‚ú® Prettier

- Runs on pre-commit. Because who doesn‚Äôt want their code auto-prettified?

### üïµÔ∏è Strict ESLint

- Leaning toward Airbnb + Unicorn configs‚Äîunless you have a spicier suggestion
- Some aggressive custom rules that I can't live without
- No warnings allowed at commit time (too strict?)

### ü™Ñ CSpell

- Spell checking everywhere
- Project-specific dictionary - still figuring out the best spot for it

### üß™ Vitest

- I'll find an example something to test, with coverage and reporting
- Docs somewhere explaining the ‚Äúwhy‚Äù of testing, not just the ‚Äúhow‚Äù

### üìñ Documentation

- Added wiki submodule for comprehensive documentation (link to full docs coming soon!)
- Explainers for each tool, folder, and weird decision

### ü§ñ GitHub Copilot

- Starter tips for using Copilot well (not just ‚Äútype // todo and hope for magic‚Äù)
- Would love to crowdsource actual examples and best practices

> If you don't know me, check out my recent blog posts on [Dev.to](https://dev.to/anchildress1) - then that last one will make perfect sense \:innocent:

## üå± How You Can Help (Without Writing a Single Line of Code)

- Share stories: What‚Äôs the most annoying thing about starting a new Node project?
- Suggest tools: What‚Äôs one library you can‚Äôt live without (and why)?
- Vote: What do you think is overkill, and what‚Äôs missing?
- Philosophize: What does a ‚Äúgood‚Äù JS backend template mean to you?

Drop your thoughts here once Discussions are enabled, or leave a comment on my [Dev.to post](https://dev.to/anchildress11/calling-all-nodejs-wizards-what-would-you-add-to-the-ultimate-boilerplate-38aj).

## üõ†Ô∏è Next Steps

- [ ] Add a starting place in Discussions for people to share their thoughts (do we really want this? ü§î)
- [ ] Set up wiki and docs for conventional commits
- [ ] Finish the basics (as described above)
- [ ] Iterate on feedback and turn this template into something worth forking

## üôè Thanks for Stopping By

Stay tuned, and thanks in advance for your brainpower! üß†üí°
‚Äî Ashley

P.S. If you‚Äôre here from the future and Discussions are already open... go wild!

> Most likely, future me forgot to update this README, so if you see any typos or outdated info, please open an issue. Thanks!
